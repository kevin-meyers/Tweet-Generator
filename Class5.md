## Class 5: Application Architecture

### Activities
- Review code with partners and use [code review rubric] to assess quality
- Compare code quality of functions based on length and responsibility
- Discuss advantages of classes and object-oriented programming (OOP)

### Objectives
After completing this class session and the associated tutorial challenges, students will be able to ...
- Assess aspects of code quality including organization and modularity
- Refactor functions that use structures as class instance methods
- Plan application architecture to prepare for future expansion

### Challenges
These challenges are the baseline required to complete the project and course.
Be sure to complete these before next class session and before starting on the stretch challenges below.
- [Page 6: Application Architecture]
    - Write down your answers to questions about application architecture
    - Implement `Dictogram` class (histogram as a subclass of `dict` type)
    - Implement `Listogram `class (histogram as a subclass of `list` type)
    - Restructure code files and functions to be more modular and flexible

### Stretch Challenges
These challenges are more difficult and help you push your skills and understanding to the next level.

    - Organize other app functions and classes based on your answers to app architecture questions
