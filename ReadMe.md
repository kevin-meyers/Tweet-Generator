# CS 1.2: How Data Structures Work

## Course Description

A project based course that looks under the hood at data structures and algorithms to see how they work. In addition to implementing these structures in an application; students will build them from scratch, analyze their complexity, and benchmark their performance to gain an understanding of their tradeoffs and when to use them in practice. Students will write scripts, functions, and library modules to use text processing tools like regular expressions, construct and sample probability distributions to create a Markov language model and gain insight into how grammar works and natural language processing techniques.

-   read and write text files stored on disk, manipulate strings, and parse into words
-   build web apps with the Flask framework and deploy to the web using Heroku
-   construct and sample probability distributions based on observed word frequencies
-   create Markov language models and use them to generate new sentences
-   write library code organized into separate independent modules with low coupling
-   run unit tests that assert functions and classes exhibit the correct behavior
-   implement core data structures including singly linked list and hash table
-   analyze complexity of iterative algorithms and data structures with visual loop counting
-   benchmark data structure and algorithm performance to understand tradeoffs
-   use regular expressions to parse and clean up text and tokenize words and sentences


## Project Tutorial

Students will complete the following guided project tutorial in this course:
